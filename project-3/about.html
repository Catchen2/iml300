        Big pharma is a term that refers to the global pharmaceutical industry.
        Specifically in the U.S., Big Pharma has been leveraging the
        government's <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/big-pharma-reaps-profits-hurting-everyday-americans/"class="underline">culture of corruption</a> to increase profits while everyday
        Americans suffer from high drug prices.

        At least <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2019/06/18/one-quarter-of-people-with-diabetes-in-the-u-s-are-rationing-their-insulin/" class="underline">1 in 4</a> of Americans with diabetes have said
        that they engaged in insulin rationing (using less insulin
        than is needed in order to make the doses last longer) as a direct result
        of the skyrocketing price of the drug. A vial of insulin, which is the
        only life-sustaining option for Type 1 diabetics, retails at around
        $300.
