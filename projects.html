      <p>
        In this project, I wanted to explore what home means to me. I narrowed
        it down to 3 things that feel the most like home: people, food, and
        places. I used old pictures to show some of my core memories of those
        things. I mainly used pictures from China because I miss that home and
        my grandparents a lot and I still can't travel back there to see them,
        so this website lets me travel back in time and remember the good times,
        places, and people in Beijing! I also included a page where you can draw
        your own home.

      <p class="sub">Project 3: Networked Justice</p>
      <p>
        This project is about corruption in America's pharmaceutical industry
        that affects everyday Americans who rely on medication to survive and
        live with chronic illnesses. As the issue becomes more apparent to the
        public, more websites, companies, and government initiatives, like the
        Insulin Act, are aiming to help make medicine more affordable for
        everyone.
